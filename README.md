# Background of Dataset  
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women and is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs as a result of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous).   
This dataset is a collection of testing data from the breast fine needle aspiration (FNA) test. It is a quick procedure to perform, which removes some of the fluids or cells from a breast lesion or cyst with a fine needle.   
Expected Outcome:  
The goal is to classify a breast cancer tumor using two training classifications and predict if it is malignant or benign.  
●	1 = Malignant (Cancer is present)   
●	0 = Benign (Cancer is absent)   

# Conclusion   
Accuracy Scores for Breast Cancer Predictions:   
Logistic Regression: 88.44%  
Random Forest: 94.72%  
Decision Tree: 100.00%  
K Neighbors Classifiers: 96.49%  
PCA: 99.41%  SVM: 97.36%  
  
Looking at the overall accuracy, the Decision Tree Model had the highest accuracy score of 100%. However, that is very rare and means there can be overfitting of the data. Our analysis found the PCA model to have the next highest accuracy score of 99.41%.
